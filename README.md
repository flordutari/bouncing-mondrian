## Bouncing-mondrian

### What?
My very first project, is a tribute to JezzBall, an arcade game developed by Microsoft(1992).

### How?
Made in JS, HTML and CSS.

---

- The more the ball bounce in the walls, the more points the player gets.
- The player has 3 lifes and 30 seconds to do as many points as posible. 
- By clicking on the screen the player can make new walls and enclose the ball so it bounce more times.
- If the ball collitionate in one of the walls when it's not completely created, the player will lose one life.
- The player can toggle direction with the spacebar.

#### Enojy it!
