## Bouncing-mondrian

### What?
My very first project, inspired in JezzBall, a Microsoft game.

### How?
Made in JS, HTML and CSS.

---

The more the ball bounce in the walls, the more points the player gets.
The player has 3 lifes and 30 seconds to do as many points as posible. 
By clicking on the screen the player can make new walls and enclose the ball so it bounce more times.
If the ball collitionate in one of the walls when it's not completely created, the player will lose one life.
The player can toggle direction with the spacebar.

#### Enojy it!
